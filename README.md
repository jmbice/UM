United Masters Inspiration

I was frustrated with how I implemented virtualization previously and thought it would be fun to try a custom virtualization. I added some of the css elements that we discussed in our interview.

# Getting Started

To install this application:

```bash
npm install
```

To run this on a local dev server:

```bash
npm -w="apps/web" run dev
```

# For Production

Don't run this app in production, its a proof of concept. If you were going to:

```bash
npm -w="apps/web" run build
```

```bash
npm -w="apps/web" start
```
